# Research around Open Source Communities

A list of research around open source and relevant quotes

## Open Source Benefits

* Harvard: Government Technology Policy, Social Value, and National Competitiveness
  * ["All of these outcomes help to increase productivity and competitiveness at the national level. In aggregate, these results show that changes in government technology policy that favor OSS can have a positive impact on both global social value and domestic national competitiveness."](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/government-technology-policy-social-value-and-national-competitiveness)
* Harvard: Learning by Contributing: Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Contribution to Crowdsourced Public Goods
  * ["Data on firm contributions to open source software (OSS), an important crowdsourced public good, is used to test the theoretical predictions. Using matching and panel data methods to help address endogeneity concerns, this study shows that contributing firms capture up to 100% more productive value from usage of OSS than their free-riding peers."](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=54809)
* World Bank: Leveraging Open Source as a Public Institution — New analysis reveals significant returns on investment in open source technologies
  * ["...achieved at least a 200% return on investment in its open source software efforts"](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/leveraging-open-source-public-institution-new-analysis-reveals-significant-returns-investment-open) ([PDF](OpenDRI-and-GeoNode-a-Case-Study-on-Institutional-Investments-in-Open-Source.pdf))
